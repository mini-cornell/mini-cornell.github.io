We have positions for **posdtocs** and **research students**. Please reach out if interested!

We are looking for multiple postdoctoral fellows to conduct NIH-funded research on neurodevelopment, aging, and mental disorders. Successful candidates will develop machine learning and computational tools for the analysis of longitudinal and multimodal brain MRI data and neuropsychological measurements. Candidates will work closely with computer scientists, clinicians, and neuroscientists in a multidisciplinary research setting, in a top-ranked department at a world-class, Ivy-league institution.

Candidates should hold a PhD (or equivalent) in engineering (e.g., computer science, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, statistics), neuroscience (e.g., computational or systems neuroscience), or a related field. The ideal candidate will have a strong background and demonstrable research track record in computational areas relevant to biomedical data analysis, including machine learning, probabilistic modeling and inference, applied statistics, computer vision/image processing, computational geometry, and/or network analysis. Expertise in neuroimaging applications and translational research is not necessary but will be considered a plus.

Please send a resume, bibliography, and a brief description of research interests to Dr. Qingyu Zhao.
