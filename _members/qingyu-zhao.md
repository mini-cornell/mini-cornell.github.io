I am an Assistant Professor in the the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medicine. I am working at the intersection between machine learning and translational research based on neuroimaging applications. My research focuses on machine-learning-based computational analysis of neuroimaging and neuropsychological data to explain brain-behavior relationships and determine biomedical phenotypes of neurological diseases. My research received K99 Pathway to Independence Award from NIH, NARSAD Young Investigator Award from BBRF, and Innovator Grant Award and Chairmanâ€™s Award for Advancing Science from Stanford Psychiatry. Before joining Cornell, I received my PhD in Computer Science from UNC Chapel Hill and was a faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. My broad interest lies in image analysis and statistical learning for the detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. See [full CV](https://stanford.edu/~qingyuz/pdfs/qingyuz_cv.pdf) for details.
